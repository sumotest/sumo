The files in this and all subdirectories are test suites together with 
input and output files for use with texttest (http://www.texttest.org).
To keep the tests as close to the real input and output as possible,
not all of them consider separate license info but all should be considered
to be distributed under the same license as the SUMO source code (EPL-2.0).
To extract a single test without using texttest use the script
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/extractTest.py which accepts the full path to the test 
to extract as an argument. It requires SUMO_HOME to be set correctly and the
binaries in SUMO_HOME/bin.

Please feel free to add and / or modify files here but keep in mind that
EPL requires that "derivative works" be licensed under the terms of the EPL
whereas "separate modules of software" may be licensed arbitrarily.
Modifications to the test files and directories listed here are all
considered derivative work.
